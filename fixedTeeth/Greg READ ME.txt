Greg- here are all of the teeth that I fixed. These are teeth of from my dissertation that were scaled incorrectly.The following teeth are too worn or broken to be used. Please delete: DSCN3284, DSCN4939, DSCN4967, DSCN5004, DSCN5008, DSCN5031.
Let me know if you have any questions!
Cheers, Juliet
